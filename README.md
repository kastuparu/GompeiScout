# GompeiScout


<Jess Elmhurst, elmhuje713>

base.html is essentially the same as from the
https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2022/05/31/python-flask-forms-with-jinja-templating/
tutorial, but I include a version of it here in templates. 

The templates folder needs to be downloaded along with the scoutApp.py file.

To run, type 'python3 scoutApp.py' in the terminal.
